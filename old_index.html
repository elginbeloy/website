          After first joining I worked on built-in software for the 
          newest generation of Google Smart Displays and some pages for 
          Routines in the Google Home App. I helped my team create 
          experiences using Dart, Flutter, JavaScript, and some 
          proprietary Google frameworks. Now I primarily work on Google 
          Payments pages which are used in Google Play, Youtube, and other 
          integrating apps / websites.

Storr (Software Engineer)
Jul 2019 - Oct 2019
As one of the early engineers in this SF-born startup, I focused on developing new features such as a cart, new UI, and updating the buying experience for a React Native app focused on social buying and selling of recommended products.
Defunct AI Startup (Co-Founder, CTO)
Apr 2018 - Jul 2019
At 16 I dropped out of high-school and moved to CA to start my own company. Both attempts (Cohereum & Levana) were focused on coding an Auto-ML platform to make building custom machine learning solutions easier for non-tech businesses. We raised a few million USD and developed an end-to-end platform for building neural nets, but ultimately failed. Nonetheless, the experience taught me a great deal about perseverance, company structure, law, technology, and machine learning.

Theia
Python, Selenium, Keras
A ML approach to measuring music similarity I built for a friend to increase click-through rates and decrease advertising cost for their music. Theia crawls YouTube Music downloading songs to compare to a baseline spitting out the top-N closest songs. Theia decides "similarity" by using the cosine distance between the second-to-last layer of a genre classification Convolutional Neural Net that takes in the music spectrograms as visual input data.
PyTinder
Python, Selenium
PyTinder is a fun side-project that aims to automate the entire Tinder lifecycle, from swiping right to the date being setup. PyTinder uses Selenium to automate interaction with the Tinder web interface and Seq2Seq LSTMs to chat with matched users.
elginbeloy.com
JavaScript, Vue
My personal website - the one you're currently viewing. I built this version in VueJS, host it on Netlify, and have it open-source on Github. The older version was built in React, and before that plain old HTML/CSS/JQuery (remember the days before Node?).
Magic (A VueJS Game)
JavaScript, Vue
A little - but fun - game I made entirely in VueJS. Fight monsters, buy new spells, find items, travel, whole lots of stuff in this little SPA game! I originally made it for task management but it became a game.
